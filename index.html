            Where ocean reaches vast and wonderful <br />
            Its ever-changing leagues of liquid light,<br />
            Beating against the shore, but leading on<br />
            The ardent vision, on and ever on,<br />
            Beyond the circled margin of the sky,<br />
            To fabled islands and to thoughts of God,<br />
            There with what radiance of majesty<br />
            The sun approaches, all the heavens lit<br />
            With torches of his couriers, all the sea<br />
            Laid with resplendent carpets for his feet!<br />
            And how the flaming arches blare and ring<br />
            With color salvos as my lord the sun<br />
            Steps from the invisible chariot of the night<br />
            And lifts his golden sceptre o'er the world!<br />
            Beholding, man becomes imperial,<br />
            And bears himself with finer confidence,<br />
            For he, yes, he, and haply who but he,<br />
            Sits on a throne co-sovereign of the day,<br />
            And smiles at fear and toil and destiny,<br />
          </p>

          <p class="poem">
            But dearer is the breaking of the dawn,<br />
            And nearer is the coming of the sun,<br />
            When, far from ocean or the level sweep<br />
            Of broad savannas, through the friendly trees,<br />
            The many-branching, close, and friendly trees,<br />
            We see the sun approaching neighborly.<br />
            Each waiting leaf is shining with the joy<br />
            He flings before him; crossed and intercrossed<br />
            With woodland mysteries of dark design,<br />
            The softly happy sky pours gladness down,<br />
            Till all the shadows twinkle with a smile,<br />
            And all the blacknesses dissolve away.<br />
            There's not a twig upon a lowly bush,<br />
            Or bit of moss that gems a hidden stone,<br />
            Or tiniest ant that creeps along the ground,<br />
            But knows his neighbor Sun, and, knowing loves.<br />
            The slender brook that winds through ferny clefts<br />
            Talks of him to the pebbles; butterflies<br />
            Carry the word of him, and reverent thrush<br />
            Sings in his praise the anthem of the woods.<br />

            Thus came the Christ: not clothed in sovereign state,<br />
            Flashing with jewels, girt with steely pride,<br />
            An empire-founder, builder of a throne,<br />
            Uplifted high above the mass of men,<br />
            And glittering on a million dazzled eyes;<br />
            But taking little children on His knee,<br />
            And pointing weary fishers to a catch,<br />
            And lingering beside a village well<br />
            To help a harlot into purity.<br />
            And trudging up and down the flinty ways<br />
            Of common life with homely, common men,<br />
            Just to give here a smile, a warning there,<br />
            Or glorify a meal by sharing it.<br />
            And so He brought the heavens very near,<br />
            For men to touch, and love, and rest upon.<br />
            And wrap their shivering bodies in its glow.<br />
            Thus to the hidden darkness of the world.<br />
            The lurking fears, the festering secret sins,<br />
            He brought the medicine of light; and thus<br />
            To lonely souls despairing of a friend,<br />
            And empty souls despairing of a good,<br />
            And bitter souls despairing of a God,<br />
            He brought a friendliness that never fails.<br />
            The treasure-key of all and endless wealth,<br />
            And showed them God low-knocking at their doors.<br />
