            Where ocean reaches vast and wonderful <br>
Its ever-changing leagues of liquid light,<br>
Beating against the shore, but leading on<br>
The ardent vision, on and ever on,<br>
Beyond the circled margin of the sky,<br>
To fabled islands and to thoughts of God,<br>
There with what radiance of majesty<br>
The sun approaches, all the heavens lit<br>
With torches of his couriers, all the sea<br>
Laid with resplendent carpets for his feet!<br>
And how the flaming arches blare and ring<br>
With color salvos as my lord the sun<br>
Steps from the invisible chariot of the night<br>
And lifts his golden sceptre o'er the world!<br>
Beholding, man becomes imperial,<br>
And bears himself with finer confidence,<br>
For he, yes, he, and haply who but he,<br>
Sits on a throne co-sovereign of the day,<br>
And smiles at fear and toil and destiny,<br>

            But dearer is the breaking of the dawn,<br>
And nearer is the coming of the sun,<br>
When, far from ocean or the level sweep<br>
Of broad savannas, through the friendly trees,<br>
The many-branching, close, and friendly trees,<br>
We see the sun approaching neighborly.<br>
Each waiting leaf is shining with the joy<br>
He flings before him; crossed and intercrossed<br>
With woodland mysteries of dark design,<br>
The softly happy sky pours gladness down,<br>
Till all the shadows twinkle with a smile,<br>
And all the blacknesses dissolve away.<br>
There's not a twig upon a lowly bush,<br>
Or bit of moss that gems a hidden stone,<br>
Or tiniest ant that creeps along the ground,<br>
But knows his neighbor Sun, and, knowing loves.<br>
The slender brook that winds through ferny clefts<br>
Talks of him to the pebbles; butterflies<br>
Carry the word of him, and reverent thrush<br>
Sings in his praise the anthem of the woods.<br>

            Thus came the Christ: not clothed in sovereign state,<br>
Flashing with jewels, girt with steely pride,<br>
An empire-founder, builder of a throne,<br>
Uplifted high above the mass of men,<br>
And glittering on a million dazzled eyes;<br>
But taking little children on His knee,<br>
And pointing weary fishers to a catch,<br>
And lingering beside a village well<br>
To help a harlot into purity.<br>
And trudging up and down the flinty ways<br>
Of common life with homely, common men,<br>
Just to give here a smile, a warning there,<br>
Or glorify a meal by sharing it.<br>
And so He brought the heavens very near,<br>
For men to touch, and love, and rest upon.<br>
And wrap their shivering bodies in its glow.<br>
Thus to the hidden darkness of the world.<br>
The lurking fears, the festering secret sins,<br>
He brought the medicine of light; and thus<br>
To lonely souls despairing of a friend,<br>
And empty souls despairing of a good,<br>
And bitter souls despairing of a God,<br>
He brought a friendliness that never fails.<br>
The treasure-key of all and endless wealth,<br>
And showed them God low-knocking at their doors.<br>

            O Sun of righteousness, Thou glorious One,<br>
Thou Majesty of majesties, Thou Might,<br>

How good to know Thee in our woodland ways,<br>
And greet Thee through the parting of the trees!<br>
